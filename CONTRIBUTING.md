# CONTRIBUTING

## Thank you for participating in this project!

To contribute, please read the following guidelines.

## Rules:

If you would like to improve this project by adding/suggesting edits to the contents, pulls requests are always welcome. Please:

* I am trying to make each list/section as self-contained as I can. So, please feel free to add duplicate links to different lists if necessary. Use [GitHub Search](https://github.com/rsapkf/goodies/search?q=something&unscoped_q=something) or [GitBook Search](https://goodies.gitbook.io/goodies/) if necessary.

* Only try to submit free **and quality** resources related to the topics included in the [table of contents](README.md#table-of-contents). Only submit __high quality__ paid resources with a `paid` tag at the end of the list you are adding to.

* Follow this convention: `[resource](link) - a short concise description` and try to put highly recommended resources first.

* If you want to open a pull request for fixing typos/minor changes, make at least 5 changes. If you want to add description to links, add at least 10.

* Check spelling and grammar.

## Quality of Resources submitted

* **Free** means *entirely* free, not [freemium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium), free trial or limited functionality resources. If some resource is freemium or offers a free trial only, mention it with a ```freemium``` tag at the end.

* Your contribution may be denied if the resource does not satisfy necessary curation.

* This repo loves open source and Linux. If your resource is closed-source or Windows/Mac specific, it may have to go through a stricter review.

Now let's make this list awesome and even more valuable!

## Todo:
- Add short description to each of the links(follow [these](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/928) guidelines).
- Better categorization

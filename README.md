## 42

This is an ongoing personal collection of over 3000+ sites and resources that I use or have used in the past to learn stuff like programming, puzzle-solving, web development and other intellectually stimulating things, categorized(more or less). Most of these are from my browser bookmarks. Contains blogs, websites, software that I use, my GitHub/GitLab/... stars(which I manage with my bookmark manager, not GH itself), Gists, Subreddits, YouTube channels, Medium/dev.to blogs, IRC channels, HN/Lobste.rs/StackOverflow/Codepen profiles/articles I follow, Podcasts I listen to, Browser Add-ons, Linux Hacks, Vim/Tmux/Emacs plugins I use and everything.

In short, this is my attempt to organize my knowledge. Feedbacks and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are appreciated.

This is a lifelong project and here are some things on the long-term roadmap:

- dynamic website with tagging system and full featured public API for this project.
- browser (Firefox / Chromium) extensions to see other similar sites in this collection like the one you're in right now.
- access to resources from the terminal.
